     <h2>What Is My Favorite Somethings?</h2>
    <p> My favorite movies are the Predator series. The reason why I like them is because the storyline and the action catches my attention and how well the
    movies where made. The reason why I got into the movies was because one day I was at my cousin's house. He introduced me to the
        the movie and from that moment I had no other favorite movie but Predator.</p>
